# Helix Jump Mechanics Experiment

## Description
This is a **learning project** created to experiment with and study the mechanics of the game *Helix Jump*. The main goal is to practice game development skills by recreating and modifying key elements of the original game.

- **What is Helix Jump?**  
  *Helix Jump* is a popular mobile game where the player controls a bouncing ball descending through a helical tower, avoiding obstacles and trying to reach the bottom.

- **What is done in this project?**  
  In this project, I experimented with the following mechanics:
  - Ball physics and bouncing behavior
  - Rotation and movement of the helical tower
  - Collision detection with platforms and obstacles
  - Scoring and level progression (if applicable)

This project is not a complete game but rather an exploration of specific game mechanics.


## How to Run
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Unity (version X.X.X or later).
3. Press the "Play" button in the Unity editor to run the scene.

*(If specific scenes or assets need to be loaded, mention them here.)*

## Additional Notes
- This project is created for educational purposes and does not include all features of the original *Helix Jump* game.
- Feel free to explore the code and experiment with the mechanics on your own!
